    <i><b>Fort San Pedro</b></i> in Cebu City is the oldest fort in the Philippines. It is located near the port area of Cebu, in an area now called as <i><b>Plaza Independencia</b></i>. 
    The fort houses a museum where you can find significant memorabilia, documents, and paintings highlighting the beginnings of Spanish rule in the Philippines.
        </p>
        
        <p>The Fort San Pedro (or the Fuerte de San Pedro in Spanish) is a military defence structure. It was built by the Spaniards under the command of <i><b>Miguel Lopez de Legazpi</b></i>, the first governor of Captaincy General of the Philippines.
             The original fort built right after the arrival of Legaspi and his expedition was made of wood. It was then replaced in the 17th century with a stone fort to repel Muslim raiders. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Today’s fort was built in 1738. It is the oldest triangular bastion fort in the country. It served as the embryo of the very first Spanish settlement in the Philippines. At the end of the 19th century during the Philippine Revolution, 
            the fort was attacked and taken by the Filipino Revolutionaries who used it as a stronghold. Cebu Fort San Pedro Gallery House Today, part of the fort is a museum that displays legacies of the Spanish government and well-preserved Spanish artifacts like documents, 
            paintings, and sculptures. The large lawn of the fort is now being used for functions like weddings, birthdays, and other occasions. But certain permits and requirements should be approved first by the designated personnel.

        <p>
            Fort San Pedro is triangular in shape. It has two sides facing the sea and the third side is facing the land. The sides facing the sea were safeguarded with cannon and the front with a strong fence made with wood. Its three bastions are named 
            <i><b>La Concepcion (southwest), Ignacio de Loyola (southeast), and San Miguel (northeast)</b></i>. Fourteen cannons were settled in their locations and most of them are still there today.
        </p>
        <p>Though considered to be the oldest, Fort San Pedro, to preserve its history and beauty, is under the care of the Cebu City government and is considered as a historical park under City Executive Order no. 08-87 of February 08, 2008 (Plaza Independencia – Fort San Pedro 
            Interim Policy and advisory Board PIFSIPAB).

            I recommend taking one of the guides as they give a great insight to the history of Fort San Pedro, but also the history of Cebu in general. I’m not sure if this service is available all of the time. I really found
             it interesting and well worth visiting. What I didn’t expect to learn is that Fort San Pedro may be haunted! There have been a lot of deaths (especially during World War II) over the years and as such bodies have been buried into the construction of the walls. There is also a chamber that contains human bones!. It all makes for some unrested souls if you believe in stuff like that.

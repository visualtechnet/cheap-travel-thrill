                alt="fort santiago front view" title="fort santiago front view" /></div> Inside the walled city of
        Intramuros in Manila lies <i><b>Fort Santiago</b></i>. It was formerly a citadel which served as headquarters
        for armies and foreign powers when the Spaniards were in control of the country. Ponds and fountains aside, it
        is most famously known for being the site of national hero’s Jose Rizal’s imprisonment shortly before he was
        executed in what is now known as the Rizal Monument in Rizal Park. </p>
        <p> After near-total destruction at the hands of the Americans during World War II and ensuing decades of
            neglect, Fort Santiago is now slowly coming back to life. The ticket counter that allows access to Fort
            Santiago is set at the gate of a large garden square called <i><b>Plaza Moriones</b></i>. The plaza used to
            be a public square until the Spanish Guardia Civil fenced it off in 1864 after an earthquake. The space
            takes its name from the 87th Spanish Governor General of the Philippines, Domingo Moriones y Murillo.
            Moriones was a tough veteran of the Carlist Wars in Spain; upon his arrival in 1877, he ended a mutiny by
            decimating the rebellious regiment. </p>
        <p> At the far end of the fort are outlooks over an industrial section of the Pasig River leading to
            <i><b>Baluarte de Santa Barbara</b></i>, a restored 18th-century Spanish military barracks where hundreds of
            Filipino and American POWs were killed in WWII; it's now the Rizaliana Furniture Hall, displaying Rizal's
            family furniture. Also of interest are various dungeon cell blocks, including one that Rizal spent his last
            night in. Brass footprints set into the pavement mark his final steps to the execution spot in Rizal Park.
        </p>

                alt="fort santiago small structure" title="fort santiago small structure" /></div> On the eve of his
        execution, Jose Rizal sadly wrote to his family to bid them farewell, “I would like to see each one of you
        before dying, though it may cost much pain. Come the most valiant, I have some important things to say.”
        Serenely accepting his tragic fate, he composed his untitled valedictory poem, which came to be known <i><b>“Mi
                Ultimo Adios.”</b></i> On 30 December 1896, Rizal calmly faced the firing squad in Bagumbayan.
        Reconstructed in 1953 after its destruction in World War II, the Museo ni Jose Rizal Fort Santiago pays tribute
        to Jose Rizal through its themed settings and relics reflecting his life, achievements, and last hours before
        his execution. The museum has five galleries: The Silid Pagninilay which contains facsimiles of his letters to
        his siblings, parents and colleagues. The Silid Piitan is Rizal’s actual prison cell, which contains a life-size
        wax effigy of Rizal by National Artist for Sculpture Guillermo Tolentino. The third gallery is Silid Paglilitis
        which replicates Rizal’s trial at the Cuartel de España through a dramatic light and sound presentation.
        Meanwhile, the Silid Kabayanihan contains a variety of artifacts such as clothing, photographs, replicas of
        Rizal’s alcohol stove and valedictory poem, a piece of Rizal’s vertebra enshrined in a reliquary, and the
        mural-size painting of Rizal’s execution by National Artist for Painting Carlos V. Francisco. Last but not the
        least, the fifth gallery is the Silid Pamana that houses various reproduction of Rizal’s sculptures, original
        sketches, personnel effects, photographs, and specimens of insects and reptiles named after Rizal. Supplementing
        the different galleries of the museum are the audio-visual room and Mi Ultimo Adios pathway where translations
        of Rizal’s valedictory poem are also on display. </p>

                <p> My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog. I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p> I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses. </p>
                <p> Please subscribe and share this article to support me on my next journey. I'd love to hear from you,
                    what would my next trip look like. </p>

            title="fort santiago front view" class="article-img" />
        <p>Inside the walled city of Intramuros in Manila lies Fort Santiago. It was formerly a citadel which served as
            headquarters for armies and foreign powers when the Spaniards were in control of the country. Ponds and
            fountains aside, it is most famously known for being the site of national hero’s Jose Rizal’s imprisonment
            shortly before he was executed in what is now known as the Rizal Monument in Rizal Park. </p>
        <p> After near-total destruction at the hands of the Americans during World War II and ensuing decades of
            neglect, Fort Santiago is now slowly coming back to life. The ticket counter that allows access to Fort
            Santiago is set at the gate of a large garden square called Plaza Moriones. The plaza used to be a public
            square until the Spanish Guardia Civil fenced it off in 1864 after an earthquake. The space takes its name
            from the 87th Spanish Governor General of the Philippines, Domingo Moriones y Murillo. Moriones was a tough
            veteran of the Carlist Wars in Spain; upon his arrival in 1877, he ended a mutiny by decimating the
            rebellious regiment. </p>

            title="fort santiago small structure" class="article-img" />
        <p>On the eve of his execution, Jose Rizal sadly wrote to his family to bid them farewell, “I would like to see
            each one of you before dying, though it may cost much pain. Come the most valiant, I have some important
            things to say.” Serenely accepting his tragic fate, he composed his untitled valedictory poem, which came to
            be known “Mi Ultimo Adios.” On 30 December 1896, Rizal calmly faced the firing squad in Bagumbayan.
            Reconstructed in 1953 after its destruction in World War II, the Museo ni Jose Rizal Fort Santiago pays
            tribute to Jose Rizal through its themed settings and relics reflecting his life, achievements, and last
            hours before his execution. The museum has five galleries: The Silid Pagninilay which contains facsimiles of
            his letters to his siblings, parents and colleagues. The Silid Piitan is Rizal’s actual prison cell, which
            contains a life-size wax effigy of Rizal by National Artist for Sculpture Guillermo Tolentino. The third
            gallery is Silid Paglilitis which replicates Rizal’s trial at the Cuartel de España through a dramatic light
            and sound presentation. Meanwhile, the Silid Kabayanihan contains a variety of artifacts such as clothing,
            photographs, replicas of Rizal’s alcohol stove and valedictory poem, a piece of Rizal’s vertebra enshrined
            in a reliquary, and the mural-size painting of Rizal’s execution by National Artist for Painting Carlos V.
            Francisco. Last but not the least, the fifth gallery is the Silid Pamana that houses various reproduction of
            Rizal’s sculptures, original sketches, personnel effects, photographs, and specimens of insects and reptiles
            named after Rizal. Supplementing the different galleries of the museum are the audio-visual room and Mi
            Ultimo Adios pathway where translations of Rizal’s valedictory poem are also on display. </p>

        <p> At the far end of the fort are outlooks over an industrial section of the Pasig River leading to Baluarte de
            Santa Barbara, a restored 18th-century Spanish military barracks where hundreds of Filipino and American
            POWs were killed in WWII; it's now the Rizaliana Furniture Hall, displaying Rizal's family furniture. Also
            of interest are various dungeon cell blocks, including one that Rizal spent his last night in. Brass
            footprints set into the pavement mark his final steps to the execution spot in Rizal Park. </p>

            Beach lovers searching for their next island paradise need not look further than the pristine white shores of <i><b>Cresta de Gallo</b></i>, a five-hectare islet located off the southern coast of <i><b>Sibuyan Island</b></i> in Romblon. It's picture postcard pretty, its sand so white, its water 
            sparkling blue. The island is largely empty, with no lodging for the night, and no stores or vendors so you do get a sense of real privacy. There is just a caretaker and small hut. It's best to bring your own food and water if you plan to stay for the day or camp overnight.
            The Philippines offers many pristine white sand beaches. And, Cresta de Gallo is only one of these many
            quiet, secluded and white sand beaches.</p>
        <p>
        The Romblon Province is now making a name as one of the favorite tourist destinations in the Philippines.
        Lies in
        it are the natural attractions including <i><b>Looc Marine Sanctuary, Cantingas River,</b></i> and <i><b>Mt. Guiting-Guiting.</b></i>
        <p>Cresta de Gallo is one of those places you hear about while you are traveling. Oh, you are in Romblon? You HAVE to go to Cresta de Gallo they would tell us. We always had it in the plans, but you know it is going to be special when it’s on the tip of the tongue of everybody who visited Sibuyan Island!

            The journey to get here is epic and you have to really put in the effort to make it here. It took us an internal flight, 4 local ferries and a private boat to reach the island…but it was worth every second of the journey.</p>
        <p>This island feels like something straight out of a movie and reminds us a lot of Bon Bon Beach. The island has two beautiful sandbars and is surrounded by the brightest blue water you have ever seen. To top it all off, its remote location means that you may even get to enjoy the island all to yourselves 
            for a few hours, as we did.

            It’s hard to describe how incredible this place is and the journey to get here makes you appreciate it even more. This is probably the biggest adventure we have ever been on with one of the greatest rewards at the end of it all. If you are looking for your own private island paradise, then look no further than Cresta de Gallo.

            <i><b>Lambug Beach</b></i> is another fine beach shyly located in Badian Municipality, Southwest of Cebu in Barangay Lambug. It is quite popular owing to its pristine white and fine sand and turquoise seawater. 

            You can do any fun activities with friends and colleagues, or something more strenuous such as competition games ? beach volleyball, swimming, running and anything you can think of doing.
        </p>
        <p>The great thing about Lambug Beach is that it is not so commercialized or being run by huge beach resort companies and such development giants. Therefore, you can find very affordable places to stay in overnight, such as homestays, bed and breakfast (B&B), native style cottages and more.

            From Cebu South Bus Terminal in Cebu City, it approximately takes four hours to get there. You can either sleep through during your travel or simply observe through your window the greeneries and sea views along the way.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            As you expected, you will find the <i><b>white and fine sand beach</b></i> in Lambug. The sandy area of the shore is wide enough for various activities that need movements such as running. 
            Of course, the white sand meets with the turquoise seawater the washes it day and night. The water can be ironically described (or oxymoronically speaking) as crystal clear and blue at the same time. You will not find much seaweeds in this part of the province. Hence, it is truly relaxing to swim in to enjoy the sea, sun, and sand.</p>
       
        <p><div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/lambug-beach-boat-beach-side-400.jpg" alt="lambug beach one boat at beach side" title="lambug beach one boat at beach side" /></div>
            Many travelers to Lambug Beach prefer to come late in the afternoon, especially among the younger generation. They leave Cebu City (if from or somewhere near Cebu) in the afternoon taking a 4 PM bus from the Cebu South Bus Terminal to arrive at around 8 PM at their destination. It is a good time to enjoy the dinner, drink something, sing songs, and then expect something amazing early in the morning - sunrise!
Yes, you should not miss the sunrise in this part of the world - it is spectacular. Get ready your camera, or if you do not have the good one, you can use your phone camera - the handiest one!</p>
        <p>Most probably, if you are a local (I mean a Pinoy born and living in the country for life!), coconut trees and other tropical plants might not be something interesting or even surprising to you. However, if you are a Pinoy (or another tropical person), you should be happy that you have such kind of tree (or palm tree) that many non-tropical people do not see every day or have never seen one in their lives.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, I love coconut trees as I was growing up with them and even supported my studies (and my family). Yes, these are the common plants you will find lining up or dotting the sides of the shorelines of Lambug Beach.

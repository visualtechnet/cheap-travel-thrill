        <p>The Mount Samat National Shrine, also known as the Shrine of Valor, is a famous historical landmark in the
            town of Pilar in Bataan This shrine was built to honor and commemorate all the Filipino and American
            soldiers who fought and died against Japanese forces during World War II. The most prominent feature of the
            shrine is a large <u>Memorial Cross</u>, standing tall at 95 meters, finished with granolithic marble. </p>
        <p> Located near its summit is the Mount Samat National Shrine, a national shrine dedicated to the fallen
            Filipino and American fallen during World War II. This tourist spot is often combined with other heritage
            attractions in Bataan, such as <u>Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar</u>. </p>
        <p> On December 1, 1945, thirty-one thousand four hundred hectares (31,400 has.) of land was declared as the
            Bataan National Park (BNP) under Proclamation No. 24. BNP sits on the mountainous terrain north of the
            Bataan Peninsula. Six mountain peaks dominates the Protected Area (PA). The BNP is situated in the
            municipalities of Hermosa, Orani, Samal, Abucay, Balanga, Pilar, Bagac and Morong. The allowed uses inside
            the BNP include agriculture, forestry and tourism. A MOA with the DENR-PAMB is a requirement. </p>

        </figure>
        <p>The Mt. Samat Shrine or “Dambana ng Kagitingan” was completed and inaugurated in 1970. The shrine is
            approximately 72 hectares from the foot up to the cross. The shrine consists of the Colonnade and the huge
            Memorial Cross. The <u>Memorial Cross</u> is a towering 555-meter structure above sea level. It is made up
            of steel
            and reinforced concrete and has an elevator and viewing gallery (arm of the cross). The annual celebration
            of the “Araw ng Kagitingan” at Mt. Samat is the most significant event in Bataan. It commemorates the
            heroism and bravery of Filipino and American soldiers who offered their lives to defend our freedom and
            democracy from invading Japanese forces during World War II. </p>

            <figcaption class="caption"> Mt. Samat Cross</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>From the Memorial Cross you can walk a certain footpath down towards a lower part of the Shrine of Valor, or
            'Dambana ng Kagitingan'. This is not just some pathway: covered with round stones carrying dark red patches;
            they are called bloodstones, and said to be stained with Japanese blood. The footpath connects the Memorial
            Cross with the Collonade. The Collonade is a great shrine complex that completely serves as a great tribute
            to the heroic actions and sacrifices the American and Filipino soldiers once made, to defend the Philippines
            against Japan. Inside the with marble covered Collonade, you can find a big altar with elegantly made glass
            murals, and also a small museum with a collection of WWII photographs, paintings, uniforms, and weapons.

        </figure>
        <p>In front of the altar a flagpole is nestled proudly carrying the Philippine flag; and on the two lateral
            walls of the Collonade, a narrative of the 'Battle of Bataan' is inscribed into marble. Around the
            colonnade, armaments are put on display; and an elegant looking cannon, surrounded by a neat little garden,
            points far away into the valleys. All in all the Collonade is, just like the Memorial Cross, a very well
            maintained site were visitors walk around with their upmost respect. </p>

                <p> My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog. I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p> I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses. </p>
                <p> Please subscribe and share this article to support me on my next journey. I'd love to hear from you,
                    what would my next trip look like. </p>

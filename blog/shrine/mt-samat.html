        <div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/mt-samat-shrine-sculptures-400.jpg"
                alt="mt samat sculptures on wall" title="mt samat sculptures on wall" /></div> The <i><b>Mount Samat
                National Shrine</b></i>, also known as the <i><b>Shrine of Valor</b></i>, is a famous historical
        landmark in the town of Pilar in Bataan This shrine was built to honor and commemorate all the Filipino and
        American soldiers who fought and died against Japanese forces during World War II. The most prominent feature of
        the shrine is a large Memorial Cross, standing tall at 95 meters, finished with granolithic marble. </p>
        <p> Located near its summit is the Mount Samat National Shrine, a national shrine dedicated to the fallen
            Filipino and American fallen during World War II. This tourist spot is often combined with other heritage
            attractions in Bataan, such as Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar. </p>
        <p> On December 1, 1945, thirty-one thousand four hundred hectares (31,400 has.) of land was declared as the
            Bataan National Park (BNP) under Proclamation No. 24. BNP sits on the mountainous terrain north of the
            Bataan Peninsula. Six mountain peaks dominates the Protected Area (PA). The BNP is situated in the
            municipalities of Hermosa, Orani, Samal, Abucay, Balanga, Pilar, Bagac and Morong. The allowed uses inside
            the BNP include agriculture, forestry and tourism. A MOA with the DENR-PAMB is a requirement. </p>
        <p>
        <div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/mt-samat-cross-mountain-view-400.jpg"
                alt="mt samat cross mountain view" title="mt samat cross mountain view" /></div> The Mt. Samat Shrine or
        <i><b>“Dambana ng Kagitingan”</b></i> was completed and inaugurated in 1970. The shrine is approximately 72
        hectares from the foot up to the cross. The shrine consists of the <i><b>Colonnade</b></i> and the huge Memorial
        Cross. The Memorial Cross is a towering 555-meter structure above sea level. It is made up of steel and
        reinforced concrete and has an elevator and viewing gallery (arm of the cross). The annual celebration of the
        “Araw ng Kagitingan” at Mt. Samat is the most significant event in Bataan. It commemorates the heroism and
        bravery of Filipino and American soldiers who offered their lives to defend our freedom and democracy from
        invading Japanese forces during World War II. </p> From the Memorial Cross you can walk a certain footpath down
        towards a lower part of the Shrine of Valor, or 'Dambana ng Kagitingan'. This is not just some pathway: covered
        with round stones carrying dark red patches; they are called <i><b>bloodstones</b></i>, and said to be stained
        with Japanese blood. The footpath connects the Memorial Cross with the Collonade. The Collonade is a great
        shrine complex that completely serves as a great tribute to the heroic actions and sacrifices the American and
        Filipino soldiers once made, to defend the Philippines against Japan. Inside the with marble covered Collonade,
        you can find a big altar with elegantly made glass murals, and also a small museum with a collection of WWII
        photographs, paintings, uniforms, and weapons. <section class="signature-bio">

                <p> My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog. I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p> I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses. </p>
                <p> Please subscribe and share this article to support me on my next journey. I'd love to hear from you,
                    what would my next trip look like. </p>

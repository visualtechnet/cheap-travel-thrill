        <span class="caption">Emilio Aguinaldo Shrine Living Room</span>
        <p>Originally the house where the first and Youngest President of the Philippines lived, this mansion in Kawit,
            Cavite also become the site where the Philippine Independence from Spanish rule was declared in 1898.
            President Emilio Aguinaldo’s home is now a national shrine that also houses a museum filled with significant
            artifacts of the historic event.</p>
        <p> Dubbed as the House of History, the Aguinaldo Mansion is the locus of a focal point in the unfolding of
            Philippine history. Constructed in 1845, the original structure of the house was of nipa-and-thatch
            material. It was reconstructed four years later using a variety of Philippine hardwood. By the 1920s, major
            renovation saw the construction of the tower and the symbolic balcony of the house. It was also during this
            period that the house was refurbished with architectural details of nationalistic themes, masonic symbols,
            and art nouveau and art deco’s artistic style prevalent during the early 20th century. The house where the
            president lived was donated to the Filipino people in 1963, a year before he passed away. In 1964, the house
            was placed under the care of the National Museum of the Philippines and was declared a national shrine
            through Republic Act No 4039. By 1972, Executive Order No 370 transferred the shrine under the care and
            maintenance of the National Historical Commission. Today, the house continues to emanate the vision of a
            free and proud nation as it perpetuates the ideals of the 1896 Revolution and the 1898 Proclamation of
            Philippine Independence. </p>

        <span class="caption"> Emilio Aguinaldo House Entrance</span>
        <p>The Museo ni Emilio Aguinaldo’s collection covers a variety of museum objects. The ground level of the house
            is a permanent exhibit on the role of Cavite during the revolution. It presents the life of the general,
            Cavite during the Spanish colonial period, and the revolution against Spain until the proclamation of
            independence on June 12, 1898. The second level is the living space of the house. Similar to the traditional
            bahay na bato structure of the 19th century; the living room, the bedrooms, dining area and kitchen can all
            be found in this level. These rooms house 19th century and early 20th century furniture and details of the
            art nouveau and art deco period of the past. Notable are the mesa altar, large dining table, Ah Tay bed and
            secret compartments oblivious to regular guests.</p>

        <span class="caption"> Weapons of War</span>
        <p> The sword fell when the Spaniards retreated from a fight against the forces General Emilio Aguinaldo. Many
            artifacts where in the gallery. The flag of the Philippines, the dress worn by Gen. Aguinaldo, the badges of
            the ‘Katipuneros’, Aguinaldo’s guns and bullets and many more. Moving forward, I came across the worn out
            “Himno Nacional Filipino – Para Canto y Piano,” the artifact before going up the stairs up the second floor.

        <p> It was old but it was beautiful. It seats near the balcony where the proclamation of Philippine independence
            was declared. Then I met Ate Ann, she showed me many of the things that few were able to see. She said that
            these rooms has to be kept closed because when visit tours come, especially elementary or high school tours,
            kids may damage the structure or the kids might get hurt by falling or tipping. So she guided me to the
            third and the rest of the floors. I was so amazed that my sweat was dripping all over me while my smile
            never stopped showing. We passed by some more rooms. The stairs were very steep. But it was not that scary
            to climb. The structure was sturdy. And that is why it's beautiful! </p>

        Originally the house where the first and <i><b>Youngest President</b></i> of the Philippines lived, this
        mansion in Kawit, Cavite also become the site where the Philippine Independence from Spanish rule was
        declared in 1898.
        <i><b>President Emilio Aguinaldo</b></i>’s home is now a national shrine that also houses a museum filled
        with significant artifacts of the historic event.
        </p>

        Dubbed as the <i><b>House of History</b></i>, the Aguinaldo Mansion is the locus of a focal point in the
        unfolding of Philippine history. Constructed in 1845, the original structure of the house was of
        nipa-and-thatch material.
        It was reconstructed four years later using a variety of Philippine hardwood. By the 1920s, major renovation
        saw the construction of the tower and the symbolic balcony of the house. It was also during this period that
        the house was refurbished with architectural details of nationalistic themes, masonic symbols, and art
        nouveau and art deco’s artistic style prevalent during the early 20th century. The house where the president
        lived
        was donated to the Filipino people in 1963, a year before he passed away. In 1964, the house was placed
        under the care of the National Museum of the Philippines and was declared a national shrine through Republic
        Act No
        4039. By 1972, Executive Order No 370 transferred the shrine under the care and maintenance of the National
        Historical Commission. Today, the house continues to emanate the vision of a free and proud nation as it
        perpetuates
        the ideals of the 1896 Revolution and the 1898 Proclamation of Philippine Independence.

        The Museo ni Emilio Aguinaldo’s collection covers a variety of museum objects. The ground level of the house
        is a permanent exhibit on the role of Cavite during the revolution. It presents the life of the general,
        Cavite
        during the Spanish colonial period, and the revolution against Spain until the proclamation of independence
        on June 12, 1898.
        The second level is the living space of the house. Similar to the traditional bahay na bato structure of the
        19th century; the living room, the bedrooms, dining area and kitchen can all be found in this level. These
        rooms house
        19th century and early 20th century furniture and details of the art nouveau and art deco period of the
        past. Notable are the mesa altar, large dining table, Ah Tay bed and secret compartments oblivious to
        regular guests.</p>

                    My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog.
                    I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales
                    and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while
                    saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses.

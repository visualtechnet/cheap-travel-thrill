        <p>Without a doubt the most famous location for wreck diving in the Philippines. The sheer volume and variety of
            wrecks at depths from less than five up to 40 metres make the waters around <u>Coron Island</u> in northern Palawan
            the sine qua non of wreck diving. A Japanese supply fleet was sunk here in 1944 including freighters, a
            seaplane tender and gunboats. The cream of the crop is The Irako, a 147 metre refrigeration ship weighing
            nearly 10,000 tonnes. </p>
        <p> Irako had been underway from Japan to Takao (i.e.Kaohsiung/Taiwan today) when she was damaged on 12 Aug 1944
            by unknown cause. Carrying a deck load of reconnaissance water planes she arrived in Coron Bay around 22 Sep
            1944 and tried to hide her presence between <u>Tangat and Lusong Island</u>. </p>
        <p> This big wreck is deep and only suitable for experienced divers. The main deck is at 33 meters, while the
            bottom is at 42 meters. Fortunately the Irako sits upright with a slight listing to port of 10° and a
            compass bearing of 260° gets you to the bow. The massive impact of the bombs can clearly be seen on the
            partially collapsed superstructure. Great penetration dives can be done here and at the deeper sections of
            the ship, but because of the depth and the risk of siltation this should be left to technical divers.</p>
        <p>Recreational divers can have a look inside the cargo holds, but should not be tempted to enter the deck
            levels here, leading deeper inside the ship and away from a safe ascent option.Large groupers inhabit the
            deeper parts of the wreck and snappers and schools of barracudas swim around the ship. There are not so many
            hard corals here, because of the depth, but you can see many black corals, sponges and soft corals.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>If you prefer to explore the exterior of shipwrecks, these are ideal. The decks are wonderfully encrusted
            with coral and swarming with fish life. There are deckhouses, masts, cranes and lookout perches. The hulls
            have rows of portholes to give glimpses into the cabins. There are still anti-aircraft guns in place and
            huge circular gun mounts. Massive holds yawn beneath you, and in places the deck has been peeled back by the
            bombs, allowing you to float safely down into the belly of the ship. </p>
        <p>If penetrating deep into wrecks is your passion, then Coron really is heaven on a stick. We’re talking
            170m-long ships! With good planning and a knowledgeable guide, you can make the most of them. You can pick
            your way through the passageways; penetrate down to lower levels; and find engine rooms with massive
            boilers, workshops strewn with tools and kitchens replete with pots and pans. </p>
        <p>For many years, this ship was mistakenly referred to as the Olympia Maru, but some careful detective work has
            revealed it to be the Morazan, a freighter supposedly built in England in 1908 and captured by the Japanese
            in Shanghai in 1941. This 95m-long vessel lies on its starboard side at a maximum depth of 25m and has four
            cargo bays to investigate. It’s an easy wreck to explore, with light streaming through many openings – it is
            possible to dive through its entire length inside the structure.</p>

                <p> My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog. I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p> I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses. </p>

                                42 metres and descending to 54m, this is strictly for technical divers and is only
                                accessed using trimix (oxygen, helium & nitrogen). What’s more, it’s only diveable a few
                                days each month, so booking ahead with a local dive operator is adviseable.</p>

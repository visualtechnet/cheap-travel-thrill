        <h1>The Irako</h1>
        <p><div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/the-irako-400.jpg" alt="the irako guy diving with gas tank" title="the irako guy diving with gas tank" /></div>
            Without a doubt the <i><b>most famous location for wreck diving</b></i> in the Philippines. The sheer volume and variety of
            wrecks at depths from less than five up to 40 metres make the waters around <i><b>Coron Island</b></i> in northern Palawan
            the sine qua non of wreck diving. A Japanese supply fleet was sunk here in 1944 including freighters, a
            seaplane tender and gunboats. The cream of the crop is <i><b>The Irako</b></i>, a 147 metre refrigeration ship weighing
            nearly 10,000 tonnes. </p>
        <p> Irako had been underway from Japan to Takao (i.e.Kaohsiung/Taiwan today) when she was damaged on 12 Aug 1944 by unknown cause. Carrying a deck load of reconnaissance
                 water planes she arrived in Coron Bay around 22 Sep 1944 and tried to hide her presence between Tangat and Lusong Island. </p>
            
            <p> This big wreck is deep and only suitable for <i><b>experienced divers</b></i>. The main deck is at 33 meters, while the bottom is at 42 meters. Fortunately the Irako sits upright with a slight listing to port of 10° and a compass bearing of 260° gets you to the bow.

                The massive impact of the bombs can clearly be seen on the partially collapsed superstructure.
                Great penetration dives can be done here and at the deeper sections of the ship, but because of the depth and the risk of siltation this should be left to technical divers. Recreational divers can have a look inside the cargo holds, but should not be 
                tempted to enter the deck levels here, leading deeper inside the ship and away from a safe ascent option.Large groupers inhabit the deeper parts of the wreck and snappers and schools of barracudas swim around the ship. There are not so many hard corals here, because of the depth, but you can see many black corals, sponges and soft corals.</p>

            <p><div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/the-irako-wreck-diving-400.jpg" alt="the irako wreck diving with diver's 2 feet" title="the irako wreck diving with diver's 2 feet" /></div>
                If you prefer to explore the exterior of shipwrecks, these are ideal. The decks are wonderfully encrusted with coral and swarming with fish life. There are deckhouses, masts, cranes and lookout perches. The hulls have rows of portholes to give glimpses into the cabins. There are still anti-aircraft guns in place and huge circular gun mounts. 
                Massive holds yawn beneath you, and in places the deck has been peeled back by the bombs, allowing you to float safely down into the belly of the ship. </p>
            <p> If penetrating deep into wrecks is your passion, then Coron really is heaven on a stick. We’re talking 170m-long ships! With good planning and a knowledgeable guide, you can make the most of them. You can pick your way through the passageways; penetrate down to lower levels; and find engine rooms with massive boilers, workshops strewn with tools and kitchens replete with pots and pans.

            </p>
            <p>
                For many years, this ship was mistakenly referred to as the <i><b>Olympia Maru</b></i>, but some careful detective work has revealed it to be the <i><b>Morazan</b></i>, a freighter supposedly built in England in 1908 and captured by the Japanese in Shanghai in 1941. This 95m-long vessel lies on its starboard side at a maximum depth of 25m and has four cargo bays to investigate. It’s an easy wreck to explore, 
                with light streaming through many openings – it is possible to dive through its entire length inside the structure.

                alt="malapascua island two guys diving" title="malapascua island two guys diving" /></div> Another World
        War II wreck just off <i><b>Malapascua Island</b></i> near the larger island of Cebu, the Pioneer is not for the
        faint of heart. Starting at a narc-inducing 42 metres and descending to 54m, this is strictly for technical
        divers and is only accessed using trimix (oxygen, helium & nitrogen). What’s more, it’s only diveable a few days
        each month, so booking ahead with a local dive operator is adviseable.</p>
        <p>A mysterious shipwreck lying 52 meters deep just off Cebu’s Malapascua Island was identified by the
            <i><b>‘Born to be Wild’</b></i> team last June 2012. Guest host Mariz Umali and a team of expert divers
            traveled to Malapascua with the task of filming and identifying shipwrecks in the area, which were
            reportedly unnamed and being illegally salvaged for their steel. Two of the three wrecks initially found
            were already salvaged, making identification near impossible. However, one lying deep at 52 meters remained
            intact. The wreck, known as <i><b>Pioneer</b></i>, was named after the M/V Pioneer Cebu, a passenger ship
            that was reportedly sunk during 1966. But some local divers who have been to the wreck doubt the ship to be
            the M/V Pioneer, instead guessing it to be the <i><b>Mogami Maru</b></i>, a World War II Japanese sub chaser
            which was sunk in 1944 somewhere in Malapascua after being bombed with torpedoes. Footage of the wreck was
            shown to Bobby Orillaneda, the National Museum’s Underwater Archeologist, who confirmed that the wreck did
            not look like a passenger ship. </p>
        <p>
        <div class="image-article"><img src="/assets/photos/malapascua-island-boat-with-divers-400.jpg"
                alt="malapascua island two guys diving" title="malapascua island two guys diving" /></div> The Born to
        be Wild researchers tried to secure archival photos of M/V Pioneer Cebu and Mogami Maru to match it with a
        diver’s sketch of the wreck. M/V Pioneer Cebu’s photo lacked a forecastle and had more masts in its bow compared
        to the sketch. A photo of <i><b>Tokachi Maru</b></i>, an exact replica and sister vessel of the Mogami Maru, was
        secured from Japan’s Museum of Maritime Science; Professor Jose identified it to be an exact match to the
        wreck’s sketch and videos. As Orillaneda shared, it is important to identify shipwrecks as soon as possible so
        as not to forget their part in history. All shipwrecks are finite, and deteriorate exponentially; if
        unidentified, the great monuments will be lost for all time.</p>
        <p>Torch is strongly recommended, as well as a serious deep dive experience! Because it is so deep, this
            Japanese World War II wreck is still in great condition. It was a gunboat in the war, and as you descend,
            you will see the guns pointing upwards towards you! It is about 60m long, in the upright position and still
            mostly in one piece. There is a torpedo hit on the stern but the prop is still remaining. The wreck has more
            fish than anywhere else on Malapascua due to its depth as well as sharks, rays, barracuda and groupers. This
            is a deep dive and we only do it using trimix. Only diveable on a few days of the month so you should
            arrange this in well in advance. </p>

                <p> My desire to travel across the beautiful country of Philippines has led me to create this blog. I've
                    always wanted to try Philippine's different local food, visit scenic places, mingle with locales and
                    experience their festivals and local hospitality.</p>
                <p> I enjoy visiting extraordinary places with breathtaking views, taking photos and videos while saving
                    money from the trip and buying memorabilia and other goodies to support local businesses. </p>
                <p> Please subscribe and share this article to support me on my next journey. I'd love to hear from you,
                    what would my next trip look like. </p>
